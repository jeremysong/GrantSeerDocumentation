GrantSeer Documentation
=======================

This documentation talks about the general rules regarding to develop for new GrantSeer with Django. It won't walk you through the procedure of creating a new Django project or a new app in an existing project. But [Django official documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/) does.

General Suggestions
------------------
* Follow [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) code style. 
* Write Python Docstring for each class and method. Follow [PEP 257](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) Docstring Conventions. 
* [PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is my favourate Python IDE. It provides Django support nicely.
